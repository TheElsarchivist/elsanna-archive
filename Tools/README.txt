The python script provided is used to add books to the archive. It was very hacked together and may now be robust in all cases.
It requires the beautifulsoup and ebooklib to function.
To use it first download the fics using fanficfare, update sourcePath to their location, and run the script.
The fics will be converted into the correct internal and folder structure for the archive and placed in C:/Archive.
A sql file will also be generate which can be used to update the database, for doing this I would reccomend SQLiteDatabaseBrowser which is available for free.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
